# TravelingSalesman

Find the path with the less cost from Timisoara to Bucharest by using a classical
TSP (see Figure 1).
Find in litterature ((Laporte, 2010), (Helsgaun, 2000), (The Traveling Salesman
Problem and Heuristics, 2013)) two different methods for the implementation of TSP
and implement it for the given problem in a programming language (Java, for
example).
Design and run benchmarking tests for both methods, reflect on the results and
conclude.
